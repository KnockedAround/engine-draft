This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.
And surprisingly updated to v13 in a difficult manner.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  
Or build using and run electron ```npm run electron:build```  
Or build it with ```ng build``` and then run it ```npm run electron```

## Unit tests

 [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
